## Prerequisites

I'm trying to have as few prerequisites as possible for this one.  That being said, the following are needed to work with AWS Copilot:

- AWS CLI - [Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Docker Desktop - [Install on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) | [Install on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
